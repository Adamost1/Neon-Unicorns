# Neon-Unicorns
## Ahnaf Hasan, Alvin Ye, Zane Wang

### Our project will generate a tic-tac-toe game in the terminal, in which the user will be facing off against an AI.
* There will be 3 difficulty levels that the user can choose from.
* The computer would randomly choose who goes first, and generate a board.
* When it is your turn, enter in a coordinate, row first, then column starting from 1. 
* Try to get three in a row!

### To run the program, first you need to clone the github repo. Then, in the terminal, navigate to the directory for Neon-Unicorns, and lastly, type in the following lines:
1. javac Woo.java
2. java Woo
